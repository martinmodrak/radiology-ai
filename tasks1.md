# Fitting and overfitting

We will use the demo app at https://codepen.io/oscarsaharoy/full/eYggrme

The app tries to fit a function to data points you entered.

You may:

- Click on empty space to add a point
- Click on a point to remove a point
- Drag points to change their position
- Change the type of fit (we will focus on linear/polynomial)


## When line is not enough

- Start with the default "linear" fit and default dataset. 
- Add/move a couple points, until you think the data is not well fit with a line.
- Switch to "polynomial" fit (keep the default order of the polynomial)
- Has the fit improved?
- Try moving a single point around. Where do you need to place the point to affect the overall fit the most?

## Find polynomial order

Paste the following in the "points" text area:

```
-0.250, 0.700
0.400, 2.00
3.00, 0.100
0.800, 0.800
-2.88, 3.33
-2.67, 2.58
-2.51, 1.80
-2.00, -0.760
-1.43, -1.23
-0.560, -0.145
-0.830, -0.535
-0.635, 0.545
-0.515, -0.745
-1.16, -0.730
-2.16, 0.650
-1.91, 1.13
-2.57, 0.785
-2.73, 1.37
-0.110, 1.14
0.265, 1.19
0.265, 1.52
0.955, 1.50
1.38, 1.52
1.84, 0.560
1.93, 0.980
2.64, -0.0400
3.21, -0.355
3.43, 0.185
3.88, -0.310
2.62, 0.740
3.36, -0.940
4.00, -1.15
1.71, 1.52
0.655, 1.13
0.865, 1.97
1.14, 2.43
1.57, 1.95
1.65, 2.57
2.16, 2.57
2.19, 2.12
-1.43, -0.325
-1.79, -0.385
-1.28, 0.380
-1.65, 0.650
3.07, 1.64
3.42, 1.17
3.55, 0.740
-3.12, 1.86
-3.44, 2.93
```

Switch to "polynomial" fit and change the order of the polynomial. Which order looks like the best generalization?
Why?

## Manual "cross-validation"

Paste the following as "points":

```
0.318, 1.85
0.800, 0.800
2.97, -0.377
1.92, -0.128
-7.14, -2.74
-6.24, -1.96
-4.25, 1.19
-1.87, 2.30
3.67, 0.881
```

- Overall idea: you can remove one point by clicking on it, see how that affects the fit and the click again to put the point back at (almost) the same place
- Try a polynomial fit of order 3
  - Which of the points produces the biggest change in fit when removed?
- Now do the same for polynomial or order 2 and then for order 1 (linear)
  - Which of the points produces the biggest change in fit when removed now?
- Which of the fits seems to generalize best?


## Zmatení nepřítele

Na odkazu níže najdete program, který se pokouší uhádnout, jakou klávesu ("f" nebo "d") zmáčknete.
Cílem je mačkat tak náhodně, že program nebude mít lepší přesnost než cca 50%. Jak nízko se dokážete dostat?
